## Introduction
We are now living in an era that has revolutionised our way of working, thinking and acting. Everything we do is simply a click away. We are children of the digital age. Recently due to  ground-breaking advancements in computer hardware and artificially intelligent algorithms we have morphed into an information era where our intelligence is our most prized possession.

Standing at the crossroad of these two highly convoluted and intertwined times we decided to take advantage of the plus points offered by both. We thus decided to come up with an application that incorporates this sense of superior intellect while at the same time is easy to use for end users.

## The need
Throughout the country, industries require forms to be filled out in the field. These forms are then manually entered into an online database which wastes time. And makes the process highly redundant. An autonomous on the go application does away with the redundancies introduced via this process.T his mundane activity can easily be avoided saving time and effort while increasing efficiency.

Can smartly be substituted by artificially intelligent algorithms which are invariant to environment conditions and require almost negligible cost. Such an autonomous system creates a more justified and unidirectional approach thereby limiting delayed or misrepresented entries.

## How does it work?
The system has a web interface, where a worker can upload images or pdf documents of scanned forms containing the hand-written text. As an initial setup, the worker has to define the different types of forms they will be processing through the system. This involves drawing bounding boxes around a demo document to define the regions of interest. 

In the next steps, the worker can upload a single scan or a batch of scanned documents to the system, and the system will generate an excel sheet containing all the responses that have been extracted from the uploaded forms. 

The system works in 4 stages:
