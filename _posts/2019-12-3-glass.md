## Introduction
In May 2017, Google showed off Google Lens and it caught the eye of almost everyone who watched the I/O 2017. However, Google said that the application won't be available for the general public until the end of the year. In order to provide apps with vision capabilities on the play store, I decided to develop and host Glass - Object Recognition at your fingertips.

As soon as I released the application, the app was featured on multiple technology news websites (started with a feature on XDA Portal - https://www.xda-developers.com/glass-image-recognition-android/).

Overnight, the application gained over 1,000 users :


The app, currently has no servers and cannot be run even if installed on device. The application reached over 10,000 installs in two weeks before it had to be shut down. Today, the application has roughly 13,000 downloads in total.
