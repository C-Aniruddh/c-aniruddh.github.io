## Introduction
I am an avid fan of the show Silicon Valley (HBO), and in their season 4, there was a joke about an application that can recognize food right from images. In the show the ultimate app could only distinguish between hot-dog and not hot-dog, but I felt that this is a huge opportunity to develop and deploy something that would actually do something similar. From the show, I took the name SeeFood!

SeeFood is a simple interface which helps you to recognise food categories with ease, a concept which was introduced in a TV Show (Silicon Valley) in S04E03. (Clipping here : https://youtu.be/5_U2TN0vk3w)

Initially, I started finding data online which might help me do this. There were two models working together to achieve proper results! The first model I built was based on the Food 101 dataset by ETH Zurich (Extremely thankful to them). The second model was built using Food-11 dataset by EPFL (Extremely thankful to them). Once I got the convolutional neural network ready, I quickly built a flask application in order to deploy the model. In this app, I also provided a way for users to provide feedback if the app did not recognise food accurately.  

The application was featured on a number of different online technology news portals along with the XDA Portal. The XDA thread I created for announcing the application can be found here : https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-seefood-straight-outta-silicon-t3611716
